            <h1>Thick vegetable soup à la Minestrone</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>I suppose you <em>could</em> call this recipe a recipe for Minestrone. It does contain ingredients commonly used to make Minestrone e.g. beans, celery, carrot, and tomatoes. That said, it contains some Asian ingredients like fish sauce and sake. Also, my family serves it differently. We don't put parmesan on top (nothing against it, it's just that parmesan is not something we normally have at hand). Finally, we like to serve this soup with pasta or rice (sometimes together!).</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>This recipe serves four.</p>

                        <li>One cup of dried beans e.g. pinto, haricot, black-eyed</li>
                        <li>Two fresh bay leaves</li>
                        <li>Pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>Two tablespoons of fish sauce</li>
                        <li>Two tablespoons of sake (omit if you have dietary restrictions against alcohol)</li>
                        <li>One-quarter cup of olive oil</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Soak the dried beans overnight.</li>
                        <li>Boil some water in a saucepan. Add the beans, and cook until somewhat soft (not mushy).</li>
                        <li>Switch off the fire and set the beans aside. Don't throw away the water for cooking the beans. You will use some of it in the soup.</li>
                        <li>Chop the onions and garlic finely.</li>
                        <li>Cut the carrot and celery into small pieces.</li>
                        <li>Heat the olive oil in a pot and add the onions. Fry them until they caramelise (about 20 to 30 minutes).</li>
                    </ol>
