            <h1>Thick vegetable soup à la Minestrone</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>I suppose you <em>could</em> call this recipe a recipe for Minestrone. It does contain ingredients commonly used to make Minestrone e.g. beans, celery, carrot, and tomatoes. That said, it contains some Asian ingredients like fish sauce and sake. Also, at home, my family serves it differently. We don't put parmesan on top (nothing against cheese, it's just that cooking cheese is not something we normally have at hand in the fridge). Finally, we like to serve this soup with pasta or rice (sometimes together!).</p>
