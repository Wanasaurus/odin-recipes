            <h1>Omelette Recipe</h1>
            <p>(Insert image here)</p>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I like to make omelettes. They are easily customisable, not difficult, taste great, and are healthy (depending on what you put inside!). This omelette dish is something that regularly appears on my family's dinner table. If your frying pan is too wide to make a nice round omelette, you can scramble the eggs instead.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>This recipe serves four.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Four eggs</li>
                        <li>Half a packet of snake beans (use string beans if you can't find snake beans)</li>
                        <li>Two cloves of garlic</li>
                        <li>Half or one tablespoon of fish sauce, depending on how savoury you'd like the omelette to be (you can also use soy sauce)</li>
                        <li>One tablespoon of mirin (omit if you have dietary restrictions against alcohol)</li>
                        <li>One tablespoon of sake or cooking rice wine (omit if you have dietary restrictions against alcohol)</li>
                        <li>Two tablespoons of neutral flavoured cooking oil e.g. canola</li>
                        <li>Pepper to taste</li>
                        </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wash the snake beans and chop them into half a centimetre sections.</li>
                        <li>Smash the garlic cloves and mince them.</li>
                        <li>Heat the oil in the frying pan. Add the garlic and fry until it turns a bit golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Add the chopped snake beans to the frying pan and cook for about five minutes.</li>
                        <li>While the snake beans are cooking, beat the eggs in a bowl. You can add a bit of water, to minimise the eggs drying out in the pan.</li>
                        <li>Add the fish sauce, mirin, sake, and pepper into the eggs and mix well.</li>
                        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
                        <li>When the surface of the omelette is almost cooked, flip the omelette and cook the other side.</li>
                        <li>Alternative one: if you have a small-sized pan, you might want to cook in batches. That way, you'll end up with two small omelettes instead of one big one.</li>
                        <li>Alternative two: if your pan is too wide to flip the omelette over without breaking, you can scramble everything together.</li>
                        <li>Serve the omelette with rice or porridge.</li>
                    </ol>
