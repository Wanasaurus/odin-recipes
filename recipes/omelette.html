                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I like to make omelettes. They are easily customisable, not difficult, taste great, and are healthy (depending on what you put inside!). This omelette dish is something that regularly appears on my family dinner table. If your frying pan is too wide to make a nice round omelette, you can scramble the eggs instead. The dish will still taste good!</p>
