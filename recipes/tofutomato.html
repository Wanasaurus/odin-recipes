            <h1>Tofu stewed in tomato sauce</h1>
                <p>(Insert image here)</p>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>I got inspiration for this dish from Vietnamese cuisine. There's a Vietnamese dish that consists of fried tofu cooked in tomato sauce. My version does not use fried tofu and contains Japanese mirin. This is a comforting dish that goes so well with rice.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>This recipe serves four.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One block of firm tofu (you can use the silken kind, but then you will have to stir the tomato sauce carefully to prevent tofu breakage)</li>
                        <li>Two and a half large tomatoes</li>  
                        <li>Five shallots</li>  
                        <li>Small thumb or knob of ginger</li>
                        <li>Two cloves of garlic</li>
                        <li>One chilli padi</li>
                        <li>One tablespoon of fish sauce</li>
                        <li>One tablespoon of mirin (if you have dietary restrictions against alcohol, use some sugar instead)</li>
                        <li>Neutral flavoured cooking oil e.g. canola</li>
                        <li>Coriander to taste</li>
                        <li>Spring onion to taste</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Chop the shallots, ginger, garlic cloves, and chilli padi into small pieces.</li>
                        <li>Slice firm tofu into small cubes.</li>
                        <li>Dice the tomatoes.</li>
                        <li>Chop coriander and spring onion and set aside. You'll use these when the stew is almost done cooking.</li>
                        <li>Heat the oil in a pot and add the shallots. Fry until they start to caramelise (about 20 to 30 minutes).</li>
                        <li>Add the chopped garlic, ginger, and chilli padi. Fry until fragrant.</li>
                        <li>Add the tomatoes and stir. Put a lid on the pot. Let the tomatoes and other ingredients cook until they become a sauce (about 15 to 20 minutes).</li>
                        <li>Put the tofu into the pot and coat well with the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Mix the fish sauce and mirin in a bowl. Pour the mixture into the pot.</li>
                        <li>Simmer the stew (with lid on) for about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occassionally.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the spring onion and coriander over the stew. Stir and let them cook for about a minute, or until fragrant.</li>
                        <li>Serve with rice.</li>
                    </ol>
